Aluminum Frames
10K Aluminum Shoring Frames are made of a special high- strength aluminum alloy. Their strength / Lite-weight ratio greatly facilitates handling and erecting. The horizontal (serrated) ledgers make climbing safer and help to secure wood planks. Jet Locks are spaced at 605mm (2ft) centers to enable frames to be inter-braced with standard Cross Braces when erected more than one tier high. 10K Shoring System is built to safely support loads of up to 10,000 pounds/leg with a Factor of Safety of 2.5:1 per CSA and SSFI.

Frame capacities vary, depending the number of tiers in height, the lengths of extensions, amount of bracing, whether inter-bracing has been used, and if there are any lateral or wind loads imposed.

The normal testing configuration of the 10K Shoring System exceeds the requirements of both the CSA and the SSFI of the USA A tower, 3 tiers high, consisting of 6ft high frames, with Screw Jacks extended 12”, top and bottom, is loaded to failure. The load rating of the frames is then determined by dividing the failure load by the required Safety Factor.

Available Sizes:

6’H x 4’W

5’H x 4’W

4’H x 4’W


Steel Frames
Steel Shoring Frames are made of high quality steel tubes and accessories which are galvanized or painted. Using the component and accessories, Steel Frames can be adapted to any geometry, steps and slopes.

10K Steel Shoring System is built to safely support loads of up to 4,535 kg (10,000 lb) with a Factor of Safety of 2.5:1 per CSA and SSFI.

Frame capacities vary, depending the number of tiers in height, the lengths of extensions, amount of bracing, whether inter-bracing has been used, and if there are any lateral or wind loads imposed.

Available Sizes:

6’H x 4’W

5’H x 4’W

4’H x 4’W

Post Shores
The Steel Post Shores are primarily used in light construction applications and re- shoring. (Consult with TTF Engineering for design).

150mm x 150mm Base / Top Plate (6in x 6in).

5mm (1/4in) steel plate including connection / alignment holes for adapting to u-heads, beams and other common post-shore applications.

Combined with stripping Handle, the Nut has 3 Additional Ears for use with hammers to ease in stripping the shore while under load.

Pins are of high grade steel, and come with attached safety cable to prevent loss of pins during transportation or on site handling.

Outer Tube is full length and continuous. Thread is cut into the outer tube providing a higher capacity, and equally important, far longer life expectancy when compared to products that are welded onto thinner walled tubes to reduce weight and cost.

TTF’s “Premium” Steel Post Shores are made of hi quality steel tubes and accessories which are galvanized to ensure many years of repeated use. Ideal of long term ownership and maximum stripping performance due to its labor saving “quick” release pin, making significant savings in the time to set, and strip the shore.

Available Sizes:

No.0 –  6′

No.1 –  10’3″

No.2 –  11′

No.3 –  13′

No.4 –  16′


Aluminum Beams
The Aluminum Beam is the most versatile and widely used element in all shoring and formwork applications. In Shoring, it is used as the joist and stringers on top of our various frame systems, as well as the joist for our fly forms systems. For wall forming, the beams are used as joist either in a vertical, or horizontal configuration, while our strongbacks complete the system by providing the backbone of the formwork, allowing tie-rod connections to be made.

Beams are made from high grade structural alloy 6351-T6, which has greater strength that 6061-T6 alloy. Reinforced side flanges resist bending and retain beam clips.

Eliminate up to 1/3 of the horizontal members and as much as 1⁄2 of the vertical support, using aluminum beams instead of wooden ones.

Reduced weight of each beam combined with fewer structural members minimizes worker strain. Lower worker fatigue means higher worker efficiency and lower cost.

All beams are available in standard lengths of 4’, 5’, 6’, 7’, 8’, 9’, 10’, 10.6’, 12’, 13’, 14’, 16’, 18’ and 20’ with plastic or wood inserts

Screw Jacks
Our 48mm (1.9in) hollow steel shaft, 813mm (30in) long with 610mm (20in) of adjustment.

The  Screw Jack plates can accommodate T-Head bolts, designed for quick and easy locking into the continuous slot on our aluminum stringer beams. When the plate is to rest on mudsills or to be used with timber stringer material, instead of aluminum, it can be secured to the timber by nailing through the holes provided in the plate or a special U-Head can be attached to the Jack Plate.

The adjusting nut handles are “stepped” to allow the Screw Jack to be solidly centered in either an Extension Tube or the frame leg, thus assuring straight alignment and rigidity.

What is Slab Scaffolding ?
Slab scaffolding, often referred to as formwork scaffolding or falsework, plays an indispensable role in the construction industry as a temporary support structure. This vital component comes into play when the task at hand involves the pouring or repair of concrete slabs or beams. Its composition is a complex interplay of vertical and horizontal elements, including steel or wooden beams, props, and bracing. Collectively, these components come together to form a robust framework, capable of bearing the substantial weight of wet concrete until it attains the requisite strength to function independently.

 

Support for Concrete: Slab scaffolding provides a stable framework to support the weight of wet concrete as it is poured and during the curing process. This ensures that the concrete sets properly and maintains the desired shape and strength.

Adjustability: Slab scaffolding is designed to be adjustable to accommodate different heights and layouts. It can be tailored to the specific requirements of the project, making it versatile for various slab configurations.

Safety: Safety is a paramount consideration in construction. Slab scaffolding is engineered to ensure the safety of workers and the structural integrity of the construction site. Properly designed and installed slab scaffolding helps prevent accidents and structural failures.

Material: Slab scaffolding can be constructed using various materials, such as steel, aluminum, or wood, depending on the project’s requirements and budget.

Reusability: In many cases, slab scaffolding components are designed for reuse in multiple projects, which can be cost-effective in the long run.


Process of Slabbing
1

Site Preparation: This includes excavation and leveling of the area where the concrete slab will be placed. Proper site preparation is crucial to ensure the slab’s stability and longevity.

2

Formwork Installation: Formwork, which can be made of wood, steel, or other materials, is set up to define the shape and dimensions of the concrete slab. It acts as a mold for the concrete.

3

Reinforcement: Depending on the specific requirements, steel reinforcement bars (rebar) may be added to provide additional strength and prevent cracking.

4

Concrete Pouring: Fresh concrete is poured into the formwork. It is spread and leveled to create a smooth, even surface. The quality of the concrete mix and the pouring process are essential for the durability of the slab.

5

Finishing: After pouring, the surface of the concrete is typically finished to ensure it is flat and smooth. This may involve using tools like trowels to create a suitable finish.

6

Curing: The concrete needs time to cure and gain strength. Curing involves keeping the concrete moist and at the right temperature to ensure it doesn’t dry out too quickly, which can lead to cracking.

7

Removal of Formwork: Once the concrete has sufficiently cured and gained strength, the formwork is removed, and the slab is left to fully set.

Safety Guidelines
All the erection crew must be equipped with harnesses and double lanyards.

Harnessed should be safety attached to horizontal members of the frame in the locations shown on diagram.

Note: It is very important to note that the hanging points should be between the knee brace and the frame leg – indicated in the attached sketch. It should never be from the middle of the frame.
